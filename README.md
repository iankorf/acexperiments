Experiments in Assetto Corsa

## aero.py (2023 Summer) ##

The theme here is making a time attack Miata or Miata-equivalent with FF and
MR layouts. What is the difference in layout? How does aero improve speed and
how does aero interact with layout?

### Layouts

+ FF 63% - typical FF distribution and what "the FWD book" recommends
+ FR 52% - it's easier to remove weight from the rear in a Miata
+ MR 45% - just a guess at a MR CoG

### Aero Packages

+ Naked - no splitter or wing
+ Split - splitter only
+ Wing - wing only
+ Full - splitter and wing

### Power, Grip, Weight

Power is increased by 25% over stock. It's generally easy to unlock a bit of
extra power with bolt-ons.

The tires are meant to be more like a 200TW than the defaults. The stock values
of SV tires are 1.22 and 1.21. The ST are slightly higher. I think there's even
more difference in lateral and longitudinal grip than AC uses. I therefore went
with values of 1.3 and 1.2 for the DX and DY.

It's easy to remove weight from a vehicle, so the mass was reduced 50 kg from
1080 to 1030. Since more weight is generally removed from the rear than the
front, the CoG of the FF is a little forward (52). Front aero weighs more than
rear aero.

```
mkdir build
python3 aero.py assettocorsa ks_mazda_miata
```

You will have to fix sounds and "Pack data" later in Content Manger.


## miata.py (2021 Fall) ##

All of the builds are versions of the NA Miata that comes with Assetto Corsa,
so you will need a standard installation of Assetto Corsa. You will also need
Content Manager, which most Assetto Corsa owners already have because it makes
a lot of customization easier.

The `miatas.py` script creates 48 vehicles, totalling about 6 GB.

(1) Unpack the `data.acd` file of the `ks_mazda_miata` into a `data` directory
using Content Manager.

(2) Use something like the command below to build the various experimental
vehicles. I did my file wrangling using Cygwin on Windows, which is why the
path below is what it is. YMMV.

```
python3 miatas.py /cygdrive/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa ks_mazda_miata ace
```

This will produce a bunch of FWD Miatas and some RWD variants with differing
levels of power and grip.

(3) Copy or move all of the directories you just made to `cars` directory in
AC.

(4) Go back to Content Manager to pack the `data` directory into a `data.acd`
file.

(5) Still in Content Manager, replace the sounds with the original NA Miata (or
something else if you prefer).

(6) You may want to modify the graphic offsets.
